# BookmarkOverlay for Mac
macOS always‑on‑top reading line overlay for PDFs. Transparent/colored overlay to track lines while reading.
This tool is a minimal macOS overlay for reading: transparent top, dark bottom, always on top.

## Run

```bash
swift run
```

## Controls

- Toggle edit mode: Shift + Cmd + Z
- Drag the edge line to set the divider
- Use the control panel to adjust opacity and color
- Quit from the control panel
- Shift + Cmd + Ctrl + Z to hide/unhide 

## Notes

- The overlay stays on the current desktop/space.
- In edit mode the overlay captures clicks; otherwise it is click-through.
